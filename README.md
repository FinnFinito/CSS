Trying some web development, begginer.

This website is free to use and modify by everyone. Do whatever you want :)

I have been doing this website using one of the udemys courses for Front End developer, my own tweaks like using grid and flexbox instead of float: left in few sections and few new transitions. Also, I'm trying to make sections on my own before the lecture starts, if I don't know something i'm looking into lessons.

Still needs some media queries adjustment for mobile and tablet screens. 

That's my first fully implemented website, so I'm kinda pround of it, anyway I know there's a long way untill I can call it "perfect" :)
